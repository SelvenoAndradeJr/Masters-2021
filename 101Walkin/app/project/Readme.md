### Masters 2021 HT-101 Walk-in and Student Project

The code is released for the Masters 2021 Shell Project for Crestron MCP-HT-101,201 class.  The walk-in archive source code as well as instructor in class demo code is included.  Archives for deployment are not included in this package and must be built using the template functionality.

**Course-Outline Page**

This page is put more for design communication than function.  It shows the manual construction of a nested list architecture with ordered and unordered lists.  This shows the different layers that can exist in an html list and how they may or may not display

```HTML
<ol type="1"> <!-- This is a tag for an ordered list with a defining property to display numbered -->             <li><h4>Project Structure</h4> 
          <ul>
              <li><p>how to edit project settings</p></li>
              <li><p>Creating project components</p></li>  
          </ul>
      </li>
</ol>
```



**Objects Page**

The objects page contains the demo code from class.  There are three CH5 objects used on this page used as input triggers and three ch5-textinput objects used in their output form for program feedback.

 The objects on the page are styled using the local .scss file in the folder in order to not overwrite any template defaults. The local .scss file has local comments to indicate which elements are being styled by the particular class.  The classes used to style the CH5 elements can be found in the documentation at  <a href = "https://developer.crestron.com">The Crestron Developer CH5 Microsite</a> specific links to CSS classes can be found in the Interactive student guide for this class.
