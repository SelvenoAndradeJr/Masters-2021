                       For this exercise we are going to create add basic CH5 components to a project that has premade divs for it.  The first sections will hold a CH5 button, The second div will
                       hold a CH5 slider. The third section will be used to hold a CH5 text input object.  Once the objects are in connect them to the respective joins noted in teh join schedule
                       marker doc that can be found in the project folder of this interface. You will also need to connect the pre-populated text input object which will receive responses from 
                       the program loaded to your VC-4 room.
                    </p>  
                    
                    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                        Once you have connected your objects open your browsers Dev Tools and select the highlight cursor.  What you will see as you hover over each image is the respective CSS
                        for that object.  This is what you will be using to style change parameters of the objects propoerties.  In you interactive student guide there are links to the showcase app
                        where you can find the specific CSS classes explained for which property the target.  You can also hover over the css class in VS Code to see the inheritance levels that you are
                        working with.
